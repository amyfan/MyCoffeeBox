    %h1 Organic Coffee from Chiapas
    %p Coming Soon: Every month weÂ´ll send you 1.1 lbs (500 grams) of fresh roasted organic coffee of the highest quality, directly from the mountains of Chiapas, Mexico. In every box you will receive a different brand to discover new flavors. When you find your perfect coffee, you can choose to keep receiving just that one, or switch as you please!
    %p We work with co-ops of indigenous growers who harvest and process the highest quality coffee under the Fair Trade and Bird Friendly Certification. Your membership represents a better quality of life for these farmers and their families, for the elimination of intermediaries considerably increases their income. Each purchase directly helps the development of their local communities.
